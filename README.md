# NoSQL: Social Network API

## Description

This project is a comprehensive API for a social networking web application designed to facilitate thought-sharing, reactions to friends' thoughts, and the management of friend lists. Leveraging the power of Express.js for efficient routing, it relies on MongoDB as the primary database solution, seamlessly integrated with the Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) library. This combination of technologies ensures robust performance and scalability, providing users with a feature-rich social networking experience.
